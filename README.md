# Golf Stats

[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qIocDwMujmPI7DJ_7OhB2iQLtrDQSNk7IsoE9D0EMQ4/edit?usp=sharing) is a Google Sheets spreadsheet that you can use to keep shot-, hole-, and round-level strokes gained statistics along with traditional stats. It is ready-to-use with detailed instructions to get started.

I used [this](https://forums.golfwrx.com/topic/1872776-strokes-gained-spreadsheet-free-and-easy-to-use/) spreadsheet, which calculates strokes gained statistics for a single round, as a jumping off point. I added the following features:
- Tracking of traditional counting stats (fairways, greens, putts, driving distance, course information, handicap index, etc.)
- The ability to add an indefinite number of rounds and track them all in one summary sheet, adding each new round to this sheet with the press of a button
- Calculation of strokes gained statistics for any desired distance bin and lie
- The ability to average any stat over any desired set of rounds
- Timeseries and scatterplots that can be set to display any stat

[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qIocDwMujmPI7DJ_7OhB2iQLtrDQSNk7IsoE9D0EMQ4/edit?usp=sharing) is a viewable version of the spreadsheet I work in.
